# JAVA DSA PRACTICE

This repository contains a collection of Java-based solutions for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems. It's designed to improve problem-solving skills and help with technical interview preparation.

## 🧠 About

This is my personal DSA practice repo where I've solved problems topic-wise using Java. Problems are taken from LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, and other coding platforms.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Language: Java  
- Tools: VS Code / IntelliJ IDEA  
- Version Control: Git & GitHub

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each topic is organized in a separate folder:

```
JAVA_DSA_PRACTICE/
├── Arrays/
├── LinkedList/
├── Recursion/
├── Trees/
├── Sorting/
└── ...
```

Each folder contains `.java` files with problem solutions.

## ✅ Topics Covered

- Arrays & Strings  
- Linked Lists  
- Stack & Queue  
- Recursion & Backtracking  
- Searching & Sorting  
- Binary Trees & BST  
- Heaps & Priority Queues  
- Graphs (DFS, BFS)  
- Dynamic Programming  
- Greedy Algorithms  
- Sliding Window  
- Bit Manipulation
